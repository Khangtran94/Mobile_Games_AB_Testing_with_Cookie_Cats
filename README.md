# Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats

Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment.

As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress. 

But where should the gates be placed? Initially the first gate was placed at level 30, but in this notebook we're going to analyze an A/B Testing where we moved the first gate in Cookie Cats from level 30 to level 40.

The bootstrap result tells us that there is strong evidence that 7-day retention is higher when the gate is at level 30 than when it is at level 40. The conclusion is: If we want to keep retention high — both 1-day and 7-day retention — we should not move the gate from level 30 to level 40
